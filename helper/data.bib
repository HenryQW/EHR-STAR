  abstract = {Epidemiological studies comprise heterogeneous data about a subject group to define disease-specific risk factors. These data contain information (features) about a subject's lifestyle, medical status as well as medical image data. Statistical regression analysis is used to evaluate these features and to identify feature combinations indicating a disease (the target feature). We propose an analysis approach of epidemiological data sets by incorporating all features in an exhaustive regression-based analysis. This approach combines all independent features w.r.t. a target feature. It provides a visualization that reveals insights into the data by highlighting relationships. The 3D Regression Heat Map, a novel 3D visual encoding, acts as an overview of the whole data set. It shows all combinations of two to three independent features with a specific target disease. Slicing through the 3D Regression Heat Map allows for the detailed analysis of the underlying relationships. Expert knowledge about disease-specific hypotheses can be included into the analysis by adjusting the regression model formulas. Furthermore, the influences of features can be assessed using a difference view comparing different calculation results. We applied our 3D Regression Heat Map method to a hepatic steatosis data set to reproduce results from a data mining-driven analysis. A qualitative analysis was conducted on a breast density data set. We were able to derive new hypotheses about relations between breast density and breast lesions with breast cancer. With the 3D Regression Heat Map, we present a visual overview of epidemiological data that allows for the first time an interactive regression-based analysis of large feature sets with respect to a disease.},

  abstract  = {Background: There is an increasing need for processing and understanding relevant information generated by the systematic collection of public health data over time. However, the analysis of those time series usually requires advanced modeling techniques, which are not necessarily mastered by staff, technicians and researchers working on public health and epidemiology. Here a user-friendly tool, EPIPOI, is presented that facilitates the exploration and extraction of parameters describing trends, seasonality and anomalies that characterize epidemiological processes. It also enables the inspection of those parameters across geographic regions. Although the visual exploration and extraction of relevant parameters from time series data is crucial in epidemiological research, until now it had been largely restricted to specialists. Methods. EPIPOI is freely available software developed in Matlab (The Mathworks Inc) that runs both on PC and Mac computers. Its friendly interface guides users intuitively through useful comparative analyses including the comparison of spatial patterns in temporal parameters. Results: EPIPOI is able to handle complex analyses in an accessible way. A prototype has already been used to assist researchers in a variety of contexts from didactic use in public health workshops to the main analytical tool in published research. Conclusions: EPIPOI can assist public health officials and students to explore time series data using a broad range of sophisticated analytical and visualization tools. It also provides an analytical environment where even advanced users can benefit by enabling a higher degree of control over model assumptions, such as those associated with detecting disease outbreaks and pandemics. {\textcopyright} 2012 Alonso and McCormick; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {Event sequence data such as electronic health records, a person's academic records, or car service records, are ordered series of events which have occurred over a period of time. Analyzing collections of event sequences can reveal common or semantically important sequential patterns. For example, event sequence analysis might reveal frequently used care plans for treating a disease, typical publishing patterns of professors, and the patterns of service that result in a well-maintained car. It is challenging, however, to visually explore large numbers of event sequences, or sequences with large numbers of event types. Existing methods focus on extracting explicitly matching patterns of events using statistical analysis to create stages of event progression over time. However, these methods fail to capture latent clusters of similar but not identical evolutions of event sequences. In this paper, we introduce a novel visualization system named EventThread which clusters event sequences into threads based on tensor analysis and visualizes the latent stage categories and evolution patterns by interactively grouping the threads by similarity into time-specific clusters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EventThread through usage scenarios in three different application domains and via interviews with an expert user.},

  abstract  = {The assessment of patient well-being is highly relevant for the early detection of diseases, for assessing the risks of therapies, or for evaluating therapy outcomes. The knowledge to assess a patient's well-being is actually tacit knowledge and thus, can only be used by the physicians themselves. The rationale of this research approach is to use visual interfaces to capture the mental models of experts and make them available more explicitly. We present a visual active learning system that enables physicians to label the well-being state of patient histories suffering prostate cancer. The labeled instances are iteratively learned in an active learning approach. In addition, the system provides models and visual interfaces for a) estimating the number of patients needed for learning, b) suggesting meaningful learning candidates and c) visual feedback on test candidates. We present the results of two evaluation strategies that prove the validity of the applied model. In a representative real-world use case, we learned the feedback of physicians on a data collection of more than 16.000 prostate cancer histories.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, sophisticated visualization methods have been developed to support both, the logical structure and the time-oriented aspects of computer-executable clinical treatment plans. However, visualizing the effects of applying treatment plans as well as supporting the exploration of effects on the patient's condition are still largely unresolved tasks. To fill this gap, we have developed a prototype that enhances known visualization methods to communicate the processes of treatment plan application together with their effects on a patient's condition in an easily understandable way. Our prototype combines the advantages of enhanced visual recognition of patterns with traditional information of parameters' development. Thus, it provides means (1) to assess success or failure of previously applied treatment plans, (2) to explore the effects of each applied clinical action on the patient's condition, and (3) to identify sub-optimal treatment choices. These means help physicians to optimize their treatment choices and enable developers of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to investigate and readjust these treatment plans. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Finding the differences and similarities between two datasets is a common analytics task. With temporal event sequence data, this task is complex because of the many ways single events and event sequences can differ between the two datasets (or cohorts) of records: the structure of the event sequences (e.g., event order, co-occurring events, or event frequencies), the attributes of events and records (e.g., patient gender), or metrics about the timestamps themselves (e.g., event duration). In exploratory analyses, running statistical tests to cover all cases is time-consuming and determining which results are significant becomes cumbersome. Current analytics tools for comparing groups of event sequences emphasize a purely statistical or purely visual approach for comparison. This paper presents a taxonomy of metrics for comparing cohorts of temporal event sequences, showing that the problem-space is bounded. We also present a visual analytics tool, CoCo (for "Cohort Comparison"), which implements balanced integration of automated statistics with an intelligent user interface to guide users to significant, distinguishing features between the cohorts. Lastly, we describe two early case studies: the first with a research team studying medical team performance in the emergency department and the second with pharmacy researchers.},

The difficulty in using EHRs for research purposes, however, is that both patient selection and record analysis must be conducted across very large, and typically very noisy datasets. Our previous work introduced EventFlow, a visualization tool that transforms an entire dataset of temporal event records into an aggregated display, allowing researchers to analyze population-level patterns and trends. As datasets become larger and more varied, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to provide a succinct, summarizing display. This paper presents a series of user-driven data simplifications that allow researchers to pare event records down to their core elements. Furthermore, we present a novel metric for measuring visual complexity, and a language for codifying disjoint strategies into an overarching simplification framework. These simplifications were used by real-world researchers to gain new and valuable insights from initially overwhelming datasets.},

  abstract = {An increasing amount of data is now accrued in medical information systems; however, the organization of this data is still primarily driven by data source, and does not support the cognitive processes of physicians. As such, new methods to visualize patient medical records are becoming imperative in order to assist physicians with clinical tasks and medical decision-making. The TimeLine system is a problem-centric temporal visualization for medical data: information contained with medical records is reorganized around medical disease entities and conditions. Automatic construction of the TimeLine display from existing clinical repositories occurs in three steps: 1) data access, which uses an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) data representation to handle distributed, heterogeneous medical databases; 2) data mapping and reorganization, reformulating data into hierarchical, problem-centric views; and 3) data visualization, which renders the display to a target presentation platform. Leveraging past work, we describe the latter two components of the TimeLine system in this paper, and the issues surrounding the creation of medical problems lists and temporal visualization of medical data. A driving factor in the development of TimeLine was creating a foundation upon which new data types and the visualization metaphors could be readily incorporated. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Electronic health records (EHRs) are quickly becoming omnipresent in healthcare, but interoperability issues and technical demands limit their use for biomedical and clinical research. Interactive and flexible software that interfaces directly with EHR data structured around a common data model (CDM) could accelerate more EHR-based research by making the data more accessible to researchers who lack computational expertise and/or domain knowledge. Results: We present PatientExploreR, an extensible application built on the R/Shiny framework that interfaces with a relational database of EHR data in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership CDM format. PatientExploreR produces patient-level interactive and dynamic reports and facilitates visualization of clinical data without any programming required. It allows researchers to easily construct and export patient cohorts from the EHR for analysis with other software. This application could enable easier exploration of patient-level data for physicians and researchers. PatientExploreR can incorporate EHR data from any institution that employs the CDM for users with approved access. The software code is free and open source under the MIT license, enabling institutions to install and users to expand and modify the application for their own purposes. Availability and implementation: PatientExploreR can be freely obtained from GitHub: https://github.com/BenGlicksberg/PatientExploreR. We provide instructions for how researchers with approved access to their institutional EHR can use this package. We also release an open sandbox server of synthesized patient data for users without EHR access to explore: http://patientexplorer.ucsf.edu.

Moreover, such sequences often result in measurable outcomes (e.g., life or death, win or loss). Collections of event sequences can be aggregated together to form event progression pathways. These pathways can then be connected with outcomes to model how alternative chains of events may lead to different results. This paper describes the Outflow visualization technique, designed to (1) aggregate multiple event sequences, (2) display the aggregate pathways through different event states with timing and cardinality, (3) summarize the pathways corresponding outcomes, and (4) allow users to explore external factors that correlate with specific pathway state transitions.

  abstract  = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain a significant amount of longitudinal information about a patient including pre-existing conditions, earlier diagnosis, previous treatments, active medications, base-line measurements for different clinical results, and much more. Unfortunately, data integration within an EHR and across different EHRs continue to be a limiting factor that threatens patient safety and the efficiency of healthcare providers. The disparate nature of the clinical data even within a single EHR often results in clinicians having to access and review a number of reports, modules, and tabs to access different data elements and clinical results. Due to the fragmented nature of EHR interfaces and the number of interactions that are needed to access clinical data, clinicians often spend a considerable part of their time going through the EHR of a patient in order to get a comprehensive overview and to be able to provide quality care. Data visualization and the integration of analytic models within graphical interfaces present a unique opportunity to effectively combine multiple clinical data sources and reduce the cognitive burden that disparate reports often have for end-users. With the ability of visualization techniques to summarize different data elements, we present a timeline-based framework to effectively aggregate and summarize the disparate clinical data of a patient enclosed within an EHR. The interface combines a set of visualization techniques with machine learning summarization approaches to optimize the process of understanding a patient's history through views that allow for easily skimming and jumping through time, filters for limiting the amount of information shown, and a hierarchy of summaries that provide an interface to view and compare different time frames.},

Manual logs and medical device data are collected by patients, but these multiple sources are presented in disparate visualization designs to the clinician-making temporal inference difficult. We conducted a design study over 18 months with clinicians performing intensive diabetes management. We present a data abstraction and novel hierarchical task abstraction for this domain. We also contribute IDMVis: a visualization tool for temporal event sequences with multidimensional, interrelated data. IDMVis includes a novel technique for folding and aligning records by dual sentinel events and scaling the intermediate timeline. We validate our design decisions based on our domain abstractions, best practices, and through a qualitative evaluation with six clinicians. The results of this study indicate that IDMVis accurately reflects the workflow of clinicians. Using IDMVis, clinicians are able to identify issues of data quality such as missing or conflicting data, reconstruct patient records when data is missing, differentiate between days with different patterns, and promote educational interventions after identifying discrepancies.},

Big health data has the potential to improve productivity, eliminate waste, and support a broad range of tasks related to disease surveillance, patient care, research, and population health management. Interactive visualizations have the potential to amplify big data's utilization. Visualizations can be used to support a variety of tasks, such as tracking the geographic distribution of diseases, analyzing the prevalence of disease, triaging medical records, predicting outbreaks, and discovering at-risk populations. Currently, many health visualization tools use simple charts, such as bar charts and scatter plots, that only represent few facets of data. These tools, while beneficial for simple perceptual and cognitive tasks, are ineffective when dealing with more complex sensemaking tasks that involve exploration of various facets and elements of big data simultaneously. There is need for sophisticated and elaborate visualizations that encode many facets of data and support human-data interaction with big data and more complex tasks. When not approached systematically, design of such visualizations is labor-intensive, and the resulting designs may not facilitate big-data-driven tasks. Conceptual frameworks that guide the design of visualizations for big data can make the design process more manageable and result in more effective visualizations. In this paper, we demonstrate how a framework-based approach can help designers create novel, elaborate, non-trivial visualizations for big health data. We present four visualizations that are components of a larger tool for making sense of large-scale public health data.},

In addition to providing efficient and accurate records for individual patients, large databases of EHRs contain valuable information about overall patient populations. While statistical insights describing an overall population are beneficial, they are often not specific enough to use as the basis for individualized patient-centric decisions. To address this challenge, we describe an approach based on patient similarity which analyzes an EHR database to extract a cohort of patient records most similar to a specific target patient. Clusters of similar patients are then visualized to allow interactive visual refinement by human experts. Statistics are then extracted from the refined patient clusters and displayed to users. The statistical insights taken from these refined clusters provide personalized guidance for complex decisions. This paper focuses on the cluster refinement stage where an expert user must interactively (a) judge the quality and contents of automatically generated similar patient clusters, and (b) refine the clusters based on his/her expertise. We describe the DICON visualization tool which allows users to interactively view and refine multidimensional similar patient clusters. We also present results from a preliminary evaluation where two medical doctors provided feedback on our approach.},

This can impede clinical diagnosis and limit their utility to genetics researchers.

In a previsous work, we introduced align, rank, and filter (ARF) to accentuate temporal ordering. In this paper, we present temporal summaries, an interactive visualization technique that highlights the prevalence of event occurrences. Temporal summaries dynamically aggregate events in multiple granularities (year, month, week, day, hour, etc.) for the purpose of spotting trends over time and comparing several groups of records. They provide affordances for analysts to perform temporal range filters. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in two extensive case studies with analysts who applied temporal summaries to search, filter, and look for patterns in electronic health records and academic records. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

Graphic data visualization should make it easier for physicians to assess the overall situation of a patient and to recognize essential changes over time. Methods: Metaphor graphics are used to sketch the most relevant parameters for characterizing a patient's situation. By repetition of the graphic object in 24 frames the situation of the ICU patient is presented in one display, usually summarizing the last 24h. Results: VIE-VISU is a data visualization system which uses multiples to present the change in the patient's status over time in graphic form. Each multiple is a highly structured metaphor graphic object. Each object visualizes important ICU porameters from circulation, ventilation, and fluid balance. Conclusion: The design using multiples promotes a focus on stability and change. A stable patient is recognizable at first sight, continuous improvement or worsening condition are easy to analyze, drastic changes in the patient's situation get the viewers attention immediately.},

  abstract      = {Clinical researchers use disease progression models to understand patient status and characterize progression patterns from longitudinal health records. One approach for disease progression modeling is to describe patient status using a small number of states that represent distinctive distributions over a set of observed measures. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and its variants are a class of models that both discover these states and make inferences of health states for patients. Despite the advantages of using the algorithms for discovering interesting patterns, it still remains challenging for medical experts to interpret model outputs, understand complex modeling parameters, and clinically make sense of the patterns. To tackle these problems, we conducted a design study with clinical scientists, statisticians, and visualization experts, with the goal to investigate disease progression pathways of chronic diseases, namely type 1 diabetes (T1D), Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As a result, we introduce DPVis which seamlessly integrates model parameters and outcomes of HMMs into interpretable and interactive visualizations. In this study, we demonstrate that DPVis is successful in evaluating disease progression models, visually summarizing disease states, interactively exploring disease progression patterns, and building, analyzing, and comparing clinically relevant patient subgroups.},

We refer to this technology as the medical information visualization assistant (MIVA). MIVA delivers multivariate biometric (bedside) data via a visualization display by transforming and organizing it into temporal resolutions that can provide contextual knowledge to clinicians. The result is a spatial organization of multiple datasets that allows rapid analysis and interpretation of trends. Findings from the usability study of the MIVA static prototype and heuristic inspection of the dynamic prototype suggest that using MIVA can yield faster and more accurate results.

  abstract  = {Event sequence data is common to a broad range of application domains, from security to health care to scholarly communication. This form of data captures information about the progression of events for an individual entity (e.g., a computer network device; a patient; an author) in the form of a series of time-stamped observations. Moreover, each event is associated with an event type (e.g., a computer login attempt, or a hospital discharge). Analyses of event sequence data have been shown to help reveal important temporal patterns, such as clinical paths resulting in improved outcomes, or an understanding of common career trajectories for scholars. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated a variety of techniques designed to overcome methodological challenges such as large volumes of data and high dimensionality. However, the effective identification and analysis of latent stages of progression, which can allow for variation within different but similarly evolving event sequences, remain a significant challenge with important real-world motivations. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised stage analysis algorithm to identify semantically meaningful progression stages as well as the critical events which help define those stages. The algorithm follows three key steps: (1) event representation estimation, (2) event sequence warping and alignment, and (3) sequence segmentation. We also present a novel visualization system, ET2, which interactively illustrates the results of the stage analysis algorithm to help reveal evolution patterns across stages. Finally, we report three forms of evaluation for ET2: (1) case studies with two real-world datasets, (2) interviews with domain expert users, and (3) a performance evaluation on the progression analysis algorithm and the visualization design.},

The algorithm features a unique combination of guided glyph placement, level-of-detail, dynamic zooming, and smooth transitions.

We also compare our placement algorithm with previous geo-spatial glyph placement algorithms. The result is a novel glyph placement solution to support multi-variate maps.},

Users can visualize the geospatial distribution of a given variable on an interactive map, and compare two or more variables using charts and tables. By employing dynamic query filters, visualizations can be narrowed down to specific ranges and regions.

Cross-sectional phenotype studies are used by genetics researchers to better understand how phenotypes vary across patients with genetic diseases, both within and between cohorts. Analyses within cohorts identify patterns between phenotypes and patients (e.g., co-occurrence) and isolate special cases (e.g., potential outliers). Comparing the variation of phenotypes between two cohorts can help distinguish how different factors affect disease manifestation (e.g., causal genes, age of onset, etc.). PhenoStacks is a novel visual analytics tool that supports the exploration of phenotype variation within and between cross-sectional patient cohorts. By leveraging the semantic hierarchy of the Human Phenotype Ontology, phenotypes are presented in context, can be grouped and clustered, and are summarized via overviews to support the exploration of phenotype distributions. The design of PhenoStacks was motivated by formative interviews with genetics researchers: we distil high-level tasks, present an algorithm for simplifying ontology topologies for visualization, and report the results of a deployment evaluation with four expert genetics researchers. The results suggest that PhenoStacks can help identify phenotype patterns, investigate data quality issues, and inform data collection design.},

  abstract = {A common type of data analysis is finding the differences and similarities between two datasets. With temporal event sequence data, this task is complex because of the variety of ways single events and sequences of events can differ between the two groups (or cohorts) of records: the structure of the event sequences (e.g., event order, co-occurring events, or frequencies of events), the attributes about the events and records (e.g., gender of a patient), or metrics about the timestamps themselves (e.g., duration of an event). Running statistical tests to cover all these cases and determining which results are significant becomes cumbersome. Current visual analytics tools for comparing groups of event sequences emphasize a purely statistical or purely visual approach for comparison. In this paper, we present a novel visual analytics tool, CoCo (for ”Cohort Comparison”), which balances automated statistics with user-driven analysis to guide users to significant, distinguishing features between the cohorts. We demonstrate the utility and impact of the visual analytics tool with a user study against a previous visualization-driven approach, EventFlow.

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1995-2012 IEEE. We present TimeSpan, an exploratory visualization tool designed to gain a better understanding of the temporal aspects of the stroke treatment process. Working with stroke experts, we seek to provide a tool to help improve outcomes for stroke victims. Time is of critical importance in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients. Every minute that the artery stays blocked, an estimated 1.9 million neurons and 12 km of myelinated axons are destroyed. Consequently, there is a critical need for efficiency of stroke treatment processes. Optimizing time to treatment requires a deep understanding of interval times. Stroke health care professionals must analyze the impact of procedures, events, and patient attributes on time - ultimately, to save lives and improve quality of life after stroke. First, we interviewed eight domain experts, and closely collaborated with two of them to inform the design of TimeSpan. We classify the analytical tasks which a visualization tool should support and extract design goals from the interviews and field observations. Based on these tasks and the understanding gained from the collaboration, we designed TimeSpan, a web-based tool for exploring multi-dimensional and temporal stroke data. We describe how TimeSpan incorporates factors from stacked bar graphs, line charts, histograms, and a matrix visualization to create an interactive hybrid view of temporal data. From feedback collected from domain experts in a focus group session, we reflect on the lessons we learned from abstracting the tasks and iteratively designing TimeSpan.},

  abstract  = {Cartograms are a popular and useful technique for depicting geo-spatial data. Dorling style and rectangular cartograms are very good for facilitating comparisons between unit areas. Each unit area is represented by the same shape such as a circle or rectangle, and the uniformity in shapes facilitates comparative judgment. However, the layout of these more abstract shapes may also simultaneously reduce the map's legibility and increase error. When we integrate univariate data into a cartogram, the recognizability of cartogram may be reduced. There is a trade-off between information recognition and geo-information accuracy. This is the inspiration behind the work we present. We attempt to increase the map's recognizability and reduce error by introducing topological features into the cartographic map. Our goal is to include topological features such as a river in a Dorling-style or rectangular cartogram to make the visual layout more recognizable, increase map cognition and reduce geo-spatial error. We believe that compared to the standard Dorling and rectangular style cartogram, adding topological features provides familiar geo-spatial cues and flexibility to enhance the recognizability of a cartogram.},

Despite the strong performance of RNNs, it is often challenging for users to understand why the model makes a particular prediction. Such black-box nature of RNNs can impede its wide adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, we have no established methods to interactively leverage users' domain expertise and prior knowledge as inputs for steering the model. Therefore, our design study aims to provide a visual analytics solution to increase interpretability and interactivity of RNNs via a joint effort of medical experts, artificial intelligence scientists, and visual analytics researchers. Following the iterative design process between the experts, we design, implement, and evaluate a visual analytics tool called RetainVis, which couples a newly improved, interpretable and interactive RNN-based model called RetainEX and visualizations for users' exploration of EMR data in the context of prediction tasks. Our study shows the effective use of RetainVis for gaining insights into how individual medical codes contribute to making risk predictions, using EMRs of patients with heart failure and cataract symptoms. Our study also demonstrates how we made substantial changes to the state-of-the-art RNN model called RETAIN in order to make use of temporal information and increase interactivity. This study will provide a useful guideline for researchers that aim to design an interpretable and interactive visual analytics tool for RNNs.},

The main requirements include the visualization, interactive exploration and explanation of both raw data and multiple levels of concepts abstracted from these data; the exploration of clinical data at different levels of temporal granularity along both absolute (calendar-based) and relative (clinically meaningful) time-lines; the exploration and dynamic visualization of the effects of simulated hypothetical modifications of raw data on the derived concepts; and the provision of generic services (such as statistics, documentation, fast search and retrieval of clinically significant concepts, amongst others). KNAVE-II has been implemented and is currently evaluated by expert clinicians in several medical domains, such as oncology, involving monitoring of chronic patients. {\textcopyright} 2004 ACM.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. A long-term goal in prostate cancer research is a sound prognosis prior to surgery, and as a consequence, data-centered research is becoming increasingly important. Currently, it takes several days to define meaningful cohorts by manually selecting patients from health record systems and performing statistical hypothesis tests with cohorts. The authors developed an efficient and effective visual-interactive system for the definition and analysis of patient cohorts. The system provides an overview of large sets of patient records and allows medical researchers to interactively drill down to relevant patient cohorts. In addition, a guidance concept helps them identify interesting relations between defined cohorts and rich sets of attributes available in the patient records. The system increases the efficiency of the researchers' analytical workflow by reducing the temporal effort from days to minutes.},

@article{Sultanum2019,
  abstract = {Before seeing a patient, physicians seek to obtain an overview of the patient's medical history. Text plays a major role in this activity since it represents the bulk of the clinical documentation, but reviewing it quickly becomes onerous when patient charts grow too large. Text visualization methods have been widely explored to manage this large scale through visual summaries that rely on information retrieval algorithms to structure text and make it amenable to visualization. However, the integration with such automated approaches comes with a number of limitations, including significant error rates and the need for healthcare providers to fine-tune algorithms without expert knowledge of their inner mechanics. In addition, several of these approaches obscure or substitute the original clinical text and therefore fail to leverage qualitative and rhetorical flavours of the clinical notes. These drawbacks have limited the adoption of text visualization and other summarization technologies in clinical practice. In this work we present Doccurate, a novel system embodying a curation-based approach for the visualization of large clinical text datasets. Our approach offers automation auditing and customizability to physicians while also preserving and extensively linking to the original text. We discuss findings of a formal qualitative evaluation conducted with 6 domain experts, shedding light onto physicians' information needs, perceived strengths and limitations of automated tools, and the importance of customization while balancing efficiency. We also present use case scenarios to showcase Doccurate's envisioned usage in practice.},
